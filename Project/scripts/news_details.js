However, the target seems unachievable given the rising number of cases that are filed at the court.</p><p>The new civil and criminal codes, introduced on August 17, 2018, states that there should be a one-year reconciliation or cooling-off period if the wife or husband declines a divorce. This cooling period has contributed to the stockpiling of divorce cases at the court.</p><p>Among the cases that have been registered in the court this fiscal year, more than 33 percent are divorce related.</p><p>In the last fiscal year, there were only 149 pending cases of divorce, whereas 366 cases of divorce have already been registered within nine months of the running fiscal year.</p><p>Employees of the court have demanded that the cooling period be shortened.</p><p>Keshavraj Kaushik, registrar at the court, said there are 515 cases of divorce in the court at present. Of them, 231 cases are pending.</p><p>According to the data of the District Court, 1,990 cases have been registered in the court until Tuesday. Among them, 1,056 cases (only 53 percent) have been settled until now.</p><p>“If there weren’t any cases of divorce, we might have been able to settle 64 percent of the pending cases till date,” said Kaushik.</p><p>In the last fiscal year, the court had settled 70 percent of its cases.</p><p>With the introduction of the new civil and criminal codes, the number of men filing for divorce has risen. In effect, the number of divorces filed in the courts has also increased.</p><p>According to legal practitioners, the number of men filing for divorce has increased due to the ease in legal provisions brought about by the implementation of the new codes. Under the new civil and criminal codes, a man can file for divorce directly at the court as opposed earlier when men seeking divorce had to file a case at the local body, which would then be forwarded to the court after a year only if deemed reasonable. For women, the process is simpler. They can directly go to the court with their divorce demand.</p>";

However, it did not levy VAT on service seekers in the following years. On the other hand, despite registering in VAT, Pathao had not raised VAT from its clients.</p><p>Both tax officials, however, said that ride-sharing companies should pay VAT because it is applicable to their businesses.</p><p>“The government has to recover VAT from these companies even if they have not raised this tax from those who have received their services,” said Thapa.</p>  <p>In fact, Tootle had created a system where VAT collected from the customers could be seen on its system, according to tax officials.</p><p>But VAT collection was not reflected on the system in latter two years. Bhatta said that they had raised VAT in the first year but discontinued it after learning that VAT was not applicable to public transport.</p><p>VAT is applicable to those whose annual turnover is over Rs2 million in case of service business, but its threshold for businesses of goods is Rs50 million.</p><p>Pathao and Tootle have emerged as an easy way to commute in the Capital because many say the ride-sharing companies save them from crammed public vehicles and expensive taxis. But the two companies were embroiled in controversy after they were found to have defaulted on taxes.</p><p>Bhatta complained that the start-ups are given tax exemptions and many other facilities in other countries but Nepal has taken a reverse course to discourage the start-ups.</p><p>“The issue emerged because the country does not have a law for intermediary businesses and I have to suffer,” said Bhatta. “Other intermediary businesses might also face similar problems until there are specific laws.”</p>";

Central bank authorities have now taken a step to deal with technology-based transactions, which they said they have found difficult to deal with, despite them being aware of such payment modalities.</p><p>The regulatory authorities acknowledged that there are some pitfalls in regulations of both the central bank and the telecom authority when it comes to digital payment applications and technologies, officials present in the meeting said.</p><p>“Today’s meeting was in line with broadening the scope of the regulations through a proper information sharing mechanism,” director of the central bank’s payment systems department, Tek Kumar Dhakal, said. “In terms of digital payments, the central bank and the telecom authority must act interdependently and pinpoint and measure the transactions happening through unregistered platforms.”</p><p>When asked about the growing use of foreign payment platforms used by Chinese tourists and businesses to make or receive payments of goods and services they acquire in Kathmandu, Dhakal echoed other officials and said that regulatory authorities were aware of the underground digital transactions. The newly-formed committee, Dhakal said, would now work to build a mechanism to route such transactions to the legal and financial net.</p><p>As per the central bank’s directive, the regulator must approve all outbound transactions but when payments from one foreign account to another are made through unregistered digital channels, the money technically doesn’t enter Nepal.</p><p>According to economists, the unregulated use of such platforms will have a negative impact in terms of forex earning and balance of payment accounting.</p><p>“The tourism sector is considered to have a multiplier effect in terms of growth, income and employment,” Chandan Sapkota, an economist based in Tokyo, told the Post on Thursday. “If money is paid in China via WeChat, then we won’t realise those benefits here.”</p><p>Meanwhile, central bank authorities said they are reviewing the application of SwiftPass, the chinese mobile payment technology company, which supports WeChat Pay and Alipay and UnionPay. But until the company receives the licence to operate in Nepal, the transactions via WeChat Pay and Alipay are illegal.</p><p>Officials said they also identified their own duties that require coordinated efforts and strategies to aid the government’s ‘Digital Nepal’ campaign.</p><p>“We have recognised that there is a growing need to address technical and financial issues related to digital payment systems in Nepal,” Min Prasad Aryal, spokesperson for the Telecommunications Authority, told the Post.</p><p>In Friday’s meeting, officials also discussed issues impacting digital financial services including digital fraud control mechanisms, quality of networks and other technical issues.</p><p>According to Aryal, the committee will now study digital payment systems and reach of mobile financial services, identify the issues hindering their expansion and then recommend policies, bylaws and regulations to resolve the issues.</p>";
